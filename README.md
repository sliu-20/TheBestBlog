Install Instructions:

Run the following commands in a terminal shell with git and python installed:

`git clone git@github.com:cnelson20/TheBestBlog.git`

`cd TheBestBlog/app/`

`python3 -m venv ~/blogenv`

Wait until that process finishes, then run:

`source ~/blogenv/bin/activate `

If you use windows, you may have to run source `~/blogenv/scripts/activate` instead

If that works, your terminal should appear something like this: <br>
`(blogenv) ~/TheBestBlog/app/`

If that's correct, just run 
`python3 app.py` and the webserver should start up and start serving pages.
