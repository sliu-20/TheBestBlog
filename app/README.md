K20: Throw Some Forking STUYLE On It
2021-11-29

NOTES:
The way this team used their templates was interesting. Each template was an extension of one file called layout.html, which contained code for a navbar and a footer. This appeared to allow the navbar to appear on each page.
Most of the tags in the html files were tagged as id, instead of class. ids are referred differently than classes in css files (# instead of .), which was pretty annoying.
I accidentally replaced everything I had worked on for the past half-hour or so with the original code due to me screwing up a rewrite. :((
