K20: Throw Some Forking STUYLE On It
2021-11-29

NOTES:
The way this team used their templates was interesting. Each template was an extension of one file called layout.html, which contained code for a navbar and a footer. This appeared to allow the navbar to appear on each page.
<br>
Most of the tags in the html files were tagged as id, instead of class. ids are referred differently than classes in css files (# instead of .), which was pretty annoying.
<br>
I accidentally replaced everything I had worked on for the past half-hour or so with the original code due to me screwing up a rewrite. :((
