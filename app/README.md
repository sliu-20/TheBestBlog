## About
* TheBestBlog is a blog hosting site. 

* On the homepage, all users are greeted to TheBestBlog, with logged in users being addressed by their username. 		
	* Users who are not logged in may register an account and/or login. Logged in users have the ability to create a new blog and logout. 
	* All users, logged in or not, are able to view all blogs stored in the site's databases, or can view a random blog. Only logged in users can create new blogs and check out their own blogs. 

* Clicking My Blogs or All Blogs on the home page brings you to a page with a list of blogs. 
	* Users may update their blogs with a new entry on the My Blogs page.
	* They may also click on one of the blogs in their My Blogs page and edit each entry of their blog or update the blog with a new entry.
	* On the All Blogs page, users can view every blog posted on the site. 
		* Viewers who are not logged in or viewers who did not make the blog can only view the blog's name and contents.
		* Viewers who have made the blog have the option to edit and update their blog.

* Clicking Random Blog brings users directly to a random blog, where the rules mentioned regarding viewing, editing, and updating blogs still apply.

## Install Instructions:

Run the following commands in a terminal shell with git and python installed:

`git clone git@github.com:cnelson20/TheBestBlog.git`

`cd TheBestBlog/app/`

`python3 -m venv ~/blogenv`

Wait until that process finishes, then run:

`source ~/blogenv/bin/activate `

If you use windows, you may have to run source `~/blogenv/scripts/activate` instead

If that works, your terminal should appear something like this: <br>
`(blogenv) ~/TheBestBlog/app/`

If that's correct, run <br>
`pip install -r ../requirements.txt`

Wait for that to complete, and then

`python3 app.py` and the webserver should start up and start serving pages.
